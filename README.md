# Art-Generator-Using-NST
###
This project is an upgradation of Neural Style Transfer model done by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge [1].\
\
In this project, I have taught a neural network to draw a painting in a white screen using styles of two different paintings.

###
An art generator model using VGG19 . The model extracts style of art from one painting and merges it with a normal picture to generate a new painting using Neural Style Transfer. Gradient Descent and Transfer Learning is used to reduce Cost Function and optimize generated image.
###
Clone this repo and then pip install requirements.txt file.
###
Then run Art_Generator.py to see generated images.
